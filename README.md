# Notes: Intro to web development class

Here I keep the notes and mini-projects code for the [Frontend Masters class: Complete Intro to Web Development, v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v3/).

You can also follow the [instructor's notes](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/) to learn the material.
